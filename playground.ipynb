The system should support three user roles—admin, nurse, and physician—each with specific permissions. Users should be able to view units, beds, and patient assignments in a live-updating board. Nurses and physicians can update patient statuses and notes, while admins can manage units, beds, and users. The board must synchronize updates across all users instantly and display who is currently online. In addition, the application should provide a public forum chat accessible to all admins, nurses, and physicians with real-time updates and clear sender attribution, and allow admins to create emergency alerts that broadcast instantly as a persistent banner to all users until dismissed.\\n\\n## Feature Requirements\\n1. Implement user registration functionality.\\n2. Implement user registration supporting admin, nurse, and physician roles.\\n3. Implement user login functionality.\\n4. Implement user logout functionality.\\n5. Persist all user accounts, role data, hospital units, beds, encounters, and patient board information using a durable, database-backed storage system.\\n6.
